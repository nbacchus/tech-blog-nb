# tech-blog-nb

This is a blog application where the user can create an account to make posts, edit posts, delete posts or vote and comment on other user's post like a social media platform. This application follows the MVC paradigm, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM and the express-session npm package for the authentication.
